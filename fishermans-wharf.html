<h2>Fishermans Wharf</h2>

<p>
Fisherman's Wharf gets its name and neighborhood characteristics from the city's early
days during the Gold Rush where Italian emigre fishermen
settled in the area and fished for the Dungeness Crab.
</p>

<p>
From then until present day it remained the home base of San Francisco's fishing fleet.
