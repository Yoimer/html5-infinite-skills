Today, San Francisco is one of the top tourist destinations in the world, ranking 33rd out of the 100 most

architecture, and its famous landmarks, including the Golden Gate Bridge, cable cars, and Chinatown. The
city is also a principal banking and finance center, and the home to more than 30 international financial
institutions, helping to make San Francisco rank eighteenth in the world's top producing cities, ninth in the
United States, and thirteenth place in the top twenty global financial centers.
